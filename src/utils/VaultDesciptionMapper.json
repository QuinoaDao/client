Earned token is swapped for and in order to acquire more of the same LP token. To complete the compounding cycle, the new USDC-USDC.e JLP is added to the farm, ready to go for the next earning event.

The borrowed AVAX is then redeposited into the same protocol, and this procedure is repeated multiple times in order to maximize interest earned, earnings which are used to acquire more AVAX. Note that this 'leveraged' multi-lending and -borrowing involves only AVAX; therefore price swings present no liquidation risk."
